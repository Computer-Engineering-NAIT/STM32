Libraries for STM32 projects.\
These libraries are written for the STM32G041 family of devices, but may be modified to work with many other chip variants.

This repo is a work in progress, and the code within is provided 'as is' - use at your own discretion. 

These libraries are under active maintenance, and may change without notice.
